# brumkong

News is what somebody somewhere wants to suppress; all the rest is advertising.

Started with Twitter as an 'mvp'. That's going OK.

- All tweets from @BrumKong should be stored forever
- They should be stored in close to native format
- They should be stored with as much content from the API as possible
- Each should have its own long lived URL
- Then interpret various pieces of content in various ways
   - Show images
   - Links to various sites
- Front page continues to be reverse chronological sort of most recent
